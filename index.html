Variables allow you to reuse any CSS value. For example if you have a large site and want
to always make sure you have the same shade of blue, create a variable with the color number
and lable it something meangful that you can use throughout your style sheet.

Nesting helps your css look like there is some kind of hierachy just like your html pages.
Though you can and most likely will run into problems if you overly nest things.
<br>
<ul>
	<li>1</li>
	<li>2</li>
	<li>3</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
	<ol>1</ol>
	<ol>2</ol>
	<ol>3</ol>
</ul>
</div>

<div id='mix'>
Vendor prefixes can be very annoying because of how much code there is for it and having to
type it over and over again. Mixins are a great way to use the same block of code multiple times.<br>
Example:

<code>
@mixin border-radius($radius) {<br>
  -webkit-border-radius: $radius;<br>
     -moz-border-radius: $radius;<br>
      -ms-border-radius: $radius;<br>
          border-radius: $radius;<br>
}

#mix { @include border-radius(10px); }
</code>
</div>
</body>
